# Ticket Web Transcripts

Every ticket conversation can be turned into a permanent, shareable **web transcript** — a readable record of the entire conversation that lives outside Discord.

## Generating a Transcript

Inside an open ticket, a support member runs:

```
.ticket transcript
```

Niko collects the conversation (up to 2,000 messages, including attachment links), saves it to the database, and posts a result card with a **View Transcript** button.

## Viewing Online

Each transcript gets a unique short ID and its own web page:

```
/transcript/<transcript-id>
```

Anyone with the link can view the transcript in a clean, dark, Discord-style page with:

- Every message with its timestamp and author
- Attachment links (clickable 📎 links)
- The channel name, category, opener, and message count

## Downloading

The transcript page includes one-click download buttons in four formats:

- **TXT** — plain text log, one line per message
- **HTML** — a styled standalone page you can save or share
- **CSV** — spreadsheet-friendly rows (timestamp, author, content, attachments)
- **JSON** — structured data for archives or tools

## Good to Know

- Transcripts are stored in Niko's database, so they survive deleting the ticket channel
- If the web base URL isn't configured, Niko falls back to attaching a plain **.txt** file instead
- Transcripts include metadata about the ticket: opener, category, claim status, channel name, and creation time

## When to Use It

1. **Before deleting a ticket** — keep a permanent record of resolved issues
2. **Escalations** — share a ticket with higher staff or the server owner
3. **Audits and disputes** — a timestamped, uneditable record of exactly what was said
