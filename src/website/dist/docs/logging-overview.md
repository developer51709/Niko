# Logging System

Niko's logging system provides comprehensive server event logging across multiple categories, each assignable to its own channel. Every log entry includes structured data, moderator attribution from the audit log, and rich formatting.

## Logging Categories

| Category | Events Logged |
|----------|--------------|
| **Members** | Join, leave, role changes, nickname changes, avatar updates, timeout events |
| **Messages** | Message edits, message deletions (with image attachments in MediaGallery) |
| **Moderation** | Warns, mutes, kicks, bans, unbans, nickname changes by moderators |
| **Channels** | Channel create, delete, update (name, topic, slowmode, NSFW, bitrate, user limit) |
| **Roles** | Role create, delete, update (name, color, hoist, mentionable, permissions) |
| **Server** | Server settings changes (name, description, verification, icon, banner, AFK channel) |
| **Invites** | Invite create, delete, and usage tracking on member joins |
| **Voice** | Voice channel joins, leaves, and moves |
| **Automod** | AutoMod actions (auto-delete, auto-mute, auto-ban, bad word detection) |

## Configuration

Open the interactive logging panel:

```
.logging
```

Click a category button to select which channel receives logs for that category. Each category can be assigned to a different channel.

### View Current Status

```
.logging status
```

Shows all categories, their assigned channels, and whether each is enabled or disabled.

## Log Format

All log entries use Discord CV2 containers with consistent formatting:

- **Title** — Event type (e.g. "Message Deleted", "Member Joined")
- **Body** — Structured details including user mentions, channel references, and timestamps
- **Target ID** — The affected user's ID for filtering
- **MediaGallery** — Image attachments from deleted messages are embedded directly in the log
- **Section + Thumbnail** — Avatar changes show the new avatar as a thumbnail
- **Moderator attribution** — Actions are attributed to the responsible moderator via audit log

## Member Logging

Tracks all member-related events:

- **Member Joined** — Account age, join method (invite code, vanity URL, or unknown), and invite usage
- **Member Left** — Lists the member's roles at time of departure
- **Avatar Updated** — Shows old and new avatar with Section + Thumbnail accessory
- **Role Changes** — Roles added and removed
- **Nickname Changes** — Old and new nickname, attributed to the moderator who changed it
- **Timeout Events** — Timeout applied/removed with moderator and expiry time

## Message Logging

Tracks message content changes:

- **Message Edited** — Shows before/after content with a jump link
- **Message Deleted** — Shows author, channel, content, and attachments:
  - Image attachments render in a **MediaGallery** component inside the log container
  - Non-image attachments are re-uploaded as Discord files
  - Messages with no text content show "*No text content*"

## Invite Tracking

Niko caches invite usage on startup and monitors for changes:

- **Invite Used** — Tracks which invite was used, by whom, and total uses
- **Vanity Invite Used** — Detects vanity URL joins
- **Unknown Join** — Logs joins where no invite match was found
- **Invite Created/Deleted** — Tracks invite lifecycle events

## Disabling Categories

You can disable specific logging categories through the interactive panel. Disabled categories won't send any log messages even if a channel is assigned.

## Rate Limiting

The logging system includes built-in rate limiting to prevent channel spam during mass events (e.g., mass-ban, raid scenarios). Log messages are queued and sent with controlled spacing.
