# Inviting Niko to Your Server

Getting Niko started in your server is simple. Follow these steps to add the bot and configure it properly.

## Step 1: Invite the Bot

1. Click the "Add to Discord" button on our website
2. Select the server you want to add Niko to
3. Review the permissions requested
4. Authorize the bot

> **Note**: You need the "Manage Server" permission to invite bots to a server.

## Step 2: Essential Permissions

For Niko to work properly, ensure it has these permissions:

- **Send Messages** - For responding to commands
- **Embed Links** - For rich command responses
- **Attach Files** - For image cards and embeds
- **Manage Messages** - For moderation features
- **Manage Roles** - For role management features
- **Manage Channels** - For channel management
- **Kick Members** - For kick moderation
- **Ban Members** - For ban moderation
- **Manage Nicknames** - For nickname changes
- **Add Reactions** - For interactive buttons
- **Use Application Commands** - For slash commands

## Step 3: Position the Bot

In your server settings, make sure Niko's role is positioned appropriately:

- Above the roles it needs to manage
- Below roles with dangerous permissions (for security)
- In a position where it can add/remove roles as needed

## Troubleshooting

If Niko isn't responding:

1. Check that the bot has the correct permissions
2. Verify Niko's role is positioned correctly
3. Try using the bot's username directly in a command
4. Check if the bot is online in your server

# Setting Up Prefix Commands

Niko supports both slash commands and traditional prefix commands. Here's how to set up and use them.

## Slash Commands (Recommended)

Slash commands are the modern way to interact with Discord bots:

- Type \`/\` in any channel to see available commands
- Search for commands by name
- Get instant parameter hints
- Commands work across all channels where Niko is present

## Prefix Commands

If you prefer traditional commands, Niko also supports prefix commands:

- Default prefix: \`.\` (dot) — or your server's custom prefix
- Use \`.help\` to see available commands
- Use \`.prefix\` to change prefixes with an interactive panel

## Setting a Custom Prefix

To set a custom prefix for your server:

\`\`\`
.prefix
\`\`\`

This opens an interactive panel where you can add or remove prefixes. Or use the dashboard to configure it visually.

## Command Types

- **Slash Commands** (\`/\`): Modern, contextual commands
- **Prefix Commands** (\`.\`): Traditional text commands
- **Hybrid Commands**: Both slash and prefix versions available

Most features are available through both command types.

# Roles and Permissions Guide

Understanding how Niko works with Discord's role system is crucial for proper setup.

## How Niko Uses Roles

Niko uses Discord's permission system to determine what actions it can take:

1. **Bot Role**: The role assigned to Niko itself determines its capabilities
2. **Command Permissions**: Some commands require specific user permissions
3. **Role Management**: Niko can add/remove roles based on configuration

## Recommended Role Setup

### Bot Role Position
Place Niko's role:
- **Above** roles it needs to assign (for autoroles, verification)
- **Below** roles with administrative permissions (security best practice)
- **Above** the @everyone role

### Permission Hierarchy
Niko needs these permissions in its role:
- View Channel (all channels)
- Send Messages (text channels)
- Embed Links (for rich responses)
- Attach Files (for images)
- Add Reactions (for buttons)

Additional permissions for specific features:
- Manage Messages (moderation)
- Manage Roles (role management)
- Kick/Ban Members (moderation commands)
- Manage Channels (channel operations)

## User Permissions

Some commands require specific permissions from the user:

- **Manage Server** permission for configuration commands
- **Kick Members** for kick commands
- **Ban Members** for ban commands
- **Manage Messages** for message management

## Troubleshooting Permission Issues

If a command fails:

1. Check Niko's role position
2. Verify Niko has the required channel permissions
3. Check if the channel has overwrite permissions blocking Niko
4. Ensure the user has the required permissions for the command

# Banking and Interest

Niko's banking system lets you earn passive income by saving your money.

## How Banking Works

### Balance vs Bank
- **Balance**: Cash you carry (used for shopping and gambling)
- **Bank**: Savings that earn interest (more secure, earns passive income)

### Bank Tiers
Higher bank tiers earn better interest rates:

| Tier | Name | Interest Rate |
|------|------|---------------|
| 0 | Basic | 0.5% daily |
| 1 | Silver | 1% daily |
| 2 | Gold | 2% daily |
| 3 | Platinum | 3% daily |
| 4 | Diamond | 5% daily |

## Interest Calculations

Interest is calculated on your **bank balance** (up to the tier cap):

\`\`\`
Interest = min(bank_balance, tier_cap) * interest_rate
\`\`\`

Interest is distributed every 30 minutes and logged to your transaction history.

## Bank Commands

### Deposit
Move money from balance to bank:

\`\`\`
.bank deposit <amount>
\`\`\`

### Withdraw
Take money from bank to balance:

\`\`\`
.bank withdraw <amount>
\`\`\`

### Bank Info
Check your bank status:

\`\`\`
.bank
\`\`\`

### Upgrade Your Vault
Raise your bank cap and interest rate:

\`\`\`
.bank upgrade
\`\`\`

## Banking Tips

1. **Deposit regularly**: More money in bank = more interest
2. **Reach higher tiers**: Better interest rates compound faster
3. **Keep some cash**: You need balance for shopping and gambling
4. **Check daily**: Interest compounds daily, so consistent saving helps

# Leveling System Overview

Niko's leveling system rewards members for participating in your server with XP and level-ups.

## How Leveling Works

### Earning XP
Members earn XP when they:
- Send messages in enabled channels
- Participate in activities
- Reach certain milestones

### Level Progression
Each level requires more XP than the last:
- Level 1: 100 XP
- Level 2: 200 XP
- Level 3: 350 XP
- (and increasing)

### XP Formula
The XP needed for each level increases progressively:
\`\`\`
XP for next level = current_level * 100 + 100
\`\`\`

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Leveling
\`\`\`
.levelconfig toggle
\`\`\`

### Set XP Multiplier
Adjust how fast members level:

\`\`\`
.levelconfig multiplier <value>
\`\`\`

### Set Cooldown
Prevent XP spam with cooldowns:

\`\`\`
.levelconfig cooldown <seconds>
\`\`\`

### Level Up Channel
Choose where level-up announcements appear:

\`\`\`
.levelconfig levelupchannel <channel>
\`\`\`

### Custom Level Up Messages
Level-up announcements are posted in the configured channel.

Use \`{user}\`, \`{level}\`, and \`{guild}\` in your message.

## Level Rewards

### Automatic Rewards
Members can be rewarded automatically on level-up:
- Role assignments
- Custom messages
- Channel announcements

### Level Roles
Assign roles at specific levels:

\`\`\`
.levelconfig levelrole <level> <role>
\`\`\`

## Leaderboards

View leveling leaderboards:

\`\`\`
.level-leaderboard
\`\`\`

Shows:
- Top leveled members
- XP totals
- Level rankings

## Leveling Tips

1. **Enable in all channels**: More channels = more XP opportunities
2. **Set reasonable multipliers**: Don't make leveling too fast or slow
3. **Use cooldowns**: Prevent XP grinding abuse
4. **Celebrate milestones**: Level-up announcements build engagement
5. **Reward participation**: Leveling encourages activity

# Leveling Configuration Guide

Fine-tune the leveling system to match your server's needs.

## Basic Settings

### Enable/Disable
Toggle the entire leveling system on or off:

\`\`\`
.levelconfig toggle
\`\`\`

When disabled, no XP is earned and level-up events don't fire.

### XP Multiplier
Adjust the rate at which members earn XP:

\`\`\`
.levelconfig multiplier <number>
\`\`\`

- \`1.0\` = Normal speed
- \`2.0\` = Double speed
- \`0.5\` = Half speed

### XP Cooldown
Set a cooldown between XP gains from messages:

\`\`\`
.levelconfig cooldown <seconds>
\`\`\`

Example: \`.levelconfig cooldown 60\` gives 60 seconds between XP from messages.

## Announcements

### Level Up Channel
Set where level-up notifications are sent:

\`\`\`
.levelconfig levelupchannel <channel>
\`\`\`

Placeholders in announcements:
- \`{user}\` - Username
- \`{level}\` - New level
- \`{guild}\` - Server name

## Level Roles

### Assigning Roles
Give roles when members reach certain levels:

\`\`\`
.levelconfig levelrole <level> <role mention or id>
\`\`\`

Example:
\`\`\`
.levelconfig levelrole 10 @Member
.levelconfig levelrole 50 @Regular
.levelconfig levelrole 100 @Veteran
\`\`\`

### Checking Progress
Members can check their stats:

\`\`\`
.level
.level @user
\`\`\`

## Resetting Leveling Data

To reset a member's leveling progress:

\`\`\`
.levelconfig resetuser <member>
\`\`\`

> **Warning**: This permanently deletes that member's leveling progress!

\`\`\`

## Moderation Logging

All moderation actions are logged to your configured log channel. Logs include:
- Who performed the action
- Who was affected
- When it happened
- The reason given

## Moderation Commands List

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| \`warn\` | Warn a member |
| \`warnings\` | View a member's warnings |
| \`clearwarnings\` | Clear a member's warnings |
| \`mute\` | Mute a member |
| \`unmute\` | Unmute a member |
| \`tempmute\` | Temporarily mute a member |
| \`kick\` | Kick a member |
| \`ban\` | Ban a member |
| \`unban\` | Unban a user by ID |

# Warning System Guide

The warning system helps track member infractions and establish patterns of behavior.

## Issuing Warnings

### Basic Warning
Warn a member with a reason:

\`\`\`
.warn <user> [reason]
\`\`\`

Example:
\`\`\`
.warn @User Spamming in general chat
\`\`\`

### Warnings with Evidence
It's helpful to include specific details:
- What rule was broken
- When it happened
- Any relevant context

## Viewing Warnings

### Check a User's Warnings
\`\`\`
.warnings <user>
\`\`\`

This shows:
- Total warning count
- Each warning with moderator and reason
- When each warning was issued

### Check Your Own Warnings
Members can check their own warnings:

\`\`\`
.warnings
\`\`\`

## Clearing Warnings

### Clear All Warnings
Remove all warnings from a member:

\`\`\`
.clearwarnings <user>
\`\`\`

### Clear Specific Warnings
Some configurations allow clearing specific warnings by ID.

## Warning Actions

### Automatic Actions
Configure automatic actions based on warning count:
- 3 warnings → Kick
- 5 warnings → Ban

### Manual Actions
Moderators can manually decide consequences based on warnings.

## Warning Best Practices

1. **Be specific**: Clear reasons help members understand what to fix
2. **Track patterns**: Multiple warnings show escalating issues
3. **Escalate appropriately**: Start with warnings, then mutes, then kicks/bans
4. **Document everything**: Warnings provide evidence if needed later
5. **Give second chances**: Warnings are a tool for correction, not just punishment

# Mute System Guide

Niko's mute system allows you to temporarily silence members who are breaking rules.

## Types of Mutes

### Regular Mute
A mute until manually removed:

\`\`\`
.mute <user> [reason]
\`\`\`

### Temporary Mute
A mute that expires automatically (duration in seconds):

\`\`\`
.tempmute <user> <seconds> [reason]
\`\`\`

Duration examples:
- \`300\` - 5 minutes
- \`1800\` - 30 minutes
- \`3600\` - 1 hour
- \`86400\` - 1 day

## How Mutes Work

### Mute Role
Niko creates a "Muted" role that:
- Blocks sending messages
- Blocks speaking in voice
- Blocks adding reactions

The role is automatically applied to muted members and removed when unmuted.

### Channel Permissions
When a member is muted:
1. The Muted role is added to the member
2. Channel permissions deny message sending for the Muted role
3. Voice permissions restrict speaking

### Automatic Unmuting
Temporary mutes are automatically removed when the duration expires. Niko checks regularly for expired mutes.

## Unmuting

### Remove a Mute
\`\`\`
.unmute <user>
\`\`\`

This removes the Muted role and restores the member's permissions.

## Mute Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| \`mute\` | Mute a member |
| \`tempmute\` | Temporarily mute a member (seconds) |
| \`unmute\` | Remove a mute |

## Mute Best Practices

1. **Use temporary mutes for minor issues**: They're less severe and auto-expire
2. **Set reasonable durations**: Match the severity of the infraction
3. **Provide reasons**: Helps members understand what to fix
4. **Follow up**: Check if behavior improves after unmuting
5. **Escalate if needed**: Repeated offenses may warrant kicks or bans

# AutoMod Overview

Niko's AutoMod system provides automated protection against common moderation issues.

## AutoMod Features

Controls link posting:
- Block all links
- Allow specific domains
- Warn on first link post

## Configuring AutoMod

### Access AutoMod Settings
Open the interactive AutoMod settings panel:

\`\`\`
.automod
\`\`\`

The panel lets admins toggle each protection module and tune thresholds with buttons and menus. You can also use the dashboard for visual configuration.

### Module Toggles
Each AutoMod feature can be toggled on/off independently from the panel:

- **Anti-spam** — detect repeated messages
- **Anti-link** — remove Discord invite links
- **Blocked words** — filter words from the server list
- **Mass mentions** — limit mention floods
- **Anti-nuke** — protect channels and roles
- **Anti-raid** — react to sudden join waves
- **External app protection** — detect user-installed app abuse

## Actions

When AutoMod detects an issue, it can:
- **Warn**: Send a warning to the member
- **Delete**: Remove the offending message
- **Mute**: Temporarily mute the member
- **Kick**: Remove the member
- **Ban**: Permanently ban the member
- **Notify**: Alert moderators

## Whitelisting

Exclude trusted users and roles from AutoMod checks:

### User Whitelist
\`\`\`
.whitelist add user <user>
\`\`\`

### Role Whitelist
\`\`\`
.whitelist add role <role>
\`\`\`

### Removing Entries
\`\`\`
.whitelist remove user <user>
.whitelist remove role <role>
\`\`\`

### Blocked Words
Manage the custom blocked word list:

\`\`\`
.badwords add <word>
.badwords remove <word>
.badwords clear
\`\`\`

## AutoMod Best Practices

1. **Start conservative**: Enable features one at a time
2. **Set appropriate thresholds**: Don't be too strict or too lenient
3. **Whitelist appropriately**: Staff and bots should be whitelisted
4. **Monitor initially**: Watch how AutoMod behaves before full deployment
5. **Adjust based on feedback**: Tweak settings based on what you observe

# Anti-Spam Configuration

Niko's anti-spam system detects and handles various types of spam behavior.

## What Counts as Spam

### Message Spam
- Sending many messages quickly
- Repeated identical messages
- Rapid content posting

### Mention Spam
- Mass mentioning users
- @everyone or @here abuse
- Role mention spam

### Content Spam
- Duplicate messages
- Copied content across channels
- Excessive emoji use

## Configuration Options

Thresholds are set from the AutoMod panel (\`.automod\`) or the web dashboard:

- **Spam messages** — how many messages trigger spam detection (default: 6)
- **Spam interval** — the time window for counting messages in seconds (default: 7)
- **Maximum mentions** — mentions allowed per message (default: 5)

## Actions

When AutoMod detects an issue, it can:
- **Warn**: Send a warning to the member
- **Delete**: Remove the offending message
- **Mute**: Temporarily mute the member

## Mass Mention Protection

Enable mass mention detection from the AutoMod panel and set the threshold there. Every mention above the threshold triggers the configured response.

## Exemptions

### Whitelist Users
Specific users can be exempt:

\`\`\`
.whitelist add user <user>
\`\`\`

### Whitelist Roles
Members with a whitelisted role are exempt:

\`\`\`
.whitelist add role <role>
\`\`\`

## Testing Anti-Spam

After configuration, test with:
1. Send messages rapidly (don't overdo it)
2. Try mass mentioning
3. Verify the correct action is taken
4. Adjust thresholds if needed

# Anti-Nuke Protection

Niko's anti-nuke system detects and responds to destructive mass-actions that could destroy your server.

## What is a Nuke?

A "nuke" is when someone with destructive permissions performs many damaging actions quickly, such as:
- Deleting multiple channels
- Removing multiple roles
- Changing many permissions
- Mass banning members

## Anti-Nuke Detection

### Tracked Actions
Niko monitors these audit log events:
- Channel deletions
- Role deletions
- Ban actions
- Kick actions
- Webhook deletions
- Channel creations (can indicate restructuring)

### Threshold System
Set how many actions trigger a response from the AutoMod panel or dashboard. Actions counted within the time window include:

- Channel deletions
- Role deletions
- Ban actions
- Kick actions
- Webhook deletions

## Actions

Choose what happens when anti-nuke triggers:

### Strip Dangerous Roles
Remove roles with dangerous permissions from the offender.

### Kick
Kick the offending member.

### Ban
Ban the offending member.

Set the action from the AutoMod panel or dashboard:

- **Strip** — remove dangerous roles from the offender
- **Kick** — kick the offending member
- **Ban** — ban the offending member

## Response

When anti-nuke triggers:
1. The offending user is immediately actioned
2. A log is sent to your moderation log channel
3. The server owner receives a DM notification
4. Further actions from that user are suppressed for a cooldown period

## Configuration

### Enable Anti-Nuke
Toggle anti-nuke from the AutoMod panel:

\`\`\`
.automod
\`\`\`

Or use the dashboard's moderation settings. Set thresholds per action (for example, 3 channel deletions or 3 bans) and choose the response action there.

## Best Practices

1. **Enable for all servers**: Anti-nuke protects against both external attacks and compromised accounts
2. **Use "strip" as default**: Less destructive than banning, still stops the attack
3. **Set reasonable thresholds**: 3 actions in 10 seconds is usually the sweet spot
4. **Monitor audit logs**: Pay attention to anti-nuke alerts
5. **Combine with other security**: Use anti-raid and proper permission management too

# Anti-Raid Protection

Anti-raid protection helps defend your server from coordinated mass-join attacks.

## What is a Raid?

A raid is when many accounts join your server simultaneously, often to:
- Spam messages
- Harass members
- Destroy channels and roles
- Mass report content

## Detection Methods

### Join Flood Detection
Detects when many members join in a short period. Configure the join threshold and join interval from the AutoMod panel or dashboard:

- **Join threshold** — how many joins trigger detection (default: 10)
- **Join interval** — the time window for counting joins in seconds (default: 10)

### New Account Detection
Filter out accounts younger than a set number of days. For example, a limit of 7 days blocks accounts less than a week old.

## Actions

When a raid is detected:

### Kick
Kick the raiding members.

### Ban
Ban the raiding members.

### Slowmode
Apply slowmode to all channels.

### Lockdown
Lock all text channels.

Set the response action from the AutoMod panel or dashboard:

- **Kick** — kick the raiding members
- **Ban** — ban the raiding members
- **Slowmode** — apply slowmode to all channels
- **Lockdown** — lock all text channels

## External App Detection

Detect members abusing user-installed apps. Enable it from the AutoMod panel; configuration includes:

- Interaction threshold: How many interactions trigger detection
- Interaction window: Time window for counting
- Join age limit: Minimum account age
- Action: What to do with detected accounts

## Configuration

### Enable Anti-Raid
Toggle anti-raid from the AutoMod panel:

\`\`\`
.automod
\`\`\`

Set the join threshold, join interval, and response action there or in the dashboard's moderation settings.

## Response

When anti-raid triggers:
1. Incoming members are checked against criteria
2. Matching members are actioned (kicked/banned)
3. Channels can be slowed or locked
4. Server owner is notified
5. Moderation logs record the event

## Best Practices

1. **Enable join flood detection**: Most raids start with mass joins
2. **Set new account limits**: Many raid accounts are freshly created
3. **Use kick for initial response**: Less permanent than ban, allows investigation
4. **Combine with anti-nuke**: Defense in depth
5. **Have a response plan**: Know what to do if a raid happens
